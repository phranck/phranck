### Heya, I'm Frank 👋

I am a Swift, SwiftUI and Objective-C software developer in a small Vienna-based startup called [Cadrage](https://www.cadrage.app). We produce software for filmmakers and for the film industry.

However, this profile is only for my private stuff. Don't be surprised that many repositories have been archived in the meantime. But they are still available here in read-only mode. I thought it might be interesting for other developers to browse or learn.

### Help needed

Besides all these archived projects there are still some in active development. Unfortunately, I don't have enough time at the moment to take care of all these projects as they deserve. Therefore, I would be very happy if anyone who is interested would contribute.

Currently, this concerns the following projects:

* [SwiftPiNFC](https://github.com/phranck/SwiftPiNFC) - I started this project on May 14, 2022. It' s a Swift wrapper for [`libnfc`](https://github.com/nfc-tools/libnfc), mostly for the Raspberry Pi. If you interested in Server Side Swift development and NFC programming, please consider contributing this project. 😃
* [Podlive for macOS](https://github.com/Podlive/podlive-macos) - This is a macOS App (written in ObjC!) for listening Podcast live streams. In the german speaking area there are really **a lot** of podcasters! And many of them are using a software setup of [Ultraschall](http://ultraschall.fm/) and [Studio Link On Air](https://studio-link.de/) to record their podcast and also stream it live at the same time. Studio Link offers an API that is used by the Podlive project. It is also available for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1208250918) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.podlive.podlive_android), among others.
